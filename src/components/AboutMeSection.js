      text: "My journey into UX started in an unexpected place‚Äîfitness. A few years ago, I built and launched a fitness app that quickly gained interest and a growing user base. Through that experience, I realized my real passion wasn‚Äôt just fitness‚Äîit was understanding user needs and crafting experiences that truly worked. That spark led me to dive into UX, eventually earning a Master's in Information Experience Design (HCI) at Pratt Institute‚Äîbest decision ever.",

      title: "Blending Engineering & Design Thinking",
      text: "With a background in industrial engineering, I‚Äôve always loved breaking down complex problems. That analytical mindset now helps me design intuitive user experiences that feel effortless for users. Today, I bring that same approach to my work at CIANA, where we empower immigrant communities in NYC. I‚Äôm focused on improving our education programs, ensuring they are more accessible and impactful. It‚Äôs inspiring to see how thoughtful design can enhance learning experiences and create new opportunities for those who need them most.",

      title: "Beyond UX: Tennis, Food, and NYC",
      text: "When I‚Äôm not designing, you‚Äôll find me on the tennis court‚Äîyes, I‚Äôm a die-hard Nadal fan (so much so that I named my dog Rafa!). Outside of UX and sports, I‚Äôm on a constant mission to uncover NYC‚Äôs best hidden food gems. There‚Äôs always a new restaurant to try, and discovering those hidden spots has become a bit of an obsession.",
